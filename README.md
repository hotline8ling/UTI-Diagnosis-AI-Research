# Predictive System for Early UTI Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and research behind a **Predictive System for Early Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Detection**. By leveraging **reduced models**, **ensemble learning through soft voting**, and advanced machine learning techniques, this project demonstrates AI's transformative potential in healthcare diagnostics.

The system was developed by a research team led by **Roj Gian D. Gorospe**, showcasing a practical application of AI in healthcare to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce biases, and optimize resource utilization.

   - AUC, Precision, Recall, Specificity, Accuracy, and F1 Score.
   - Ensemble models achieved:
     - **AUC**: 95.2%
     - **Recall**: 94.4% (Overall) and 93.7% (Reduced)

5. **Data Handling**:
   - Focused on urinalysis test results with 10-parameter dipsticks.
   - Extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and reliability.

## Dataset

- Data sourced from clinical diagnostics centers in the Philippines (2020-2024).
- Preprocessed for:
  - **Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, nulls, and inconsistencies.
  - **Normalization**: Scaling features for model compatibility.
  - **Validation**: Reviewed by a certified internal medicine doctor.

- **Stratified Data**:
  - Age groups: 0-6, 7-18, 19-40, 41-60 years.
  - Total observations: 412 samples.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. Data cleaning and normalization.
2. Feature engineering based on SHAP analysis.
3. Splitting: Training (70%), Validation (20%), Test (30%).

### Modeling
- Models trained on both full and reduced datasets.
- Ensemble models designed to aggregate predictions through soft voting.

### Statistical Analysis
- Approximate z-test used to assess statistical significance of results.
- Ensured no significant difference between full and reduced models, validating the efficiency of reduced models.
